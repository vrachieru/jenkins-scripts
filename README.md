    Handy one-off script console scripts for Jenkins.
<p>

Jenkins features a nice Groovy [script console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console) which allows one to run arbitrary Groovy scripts within the Jenkins master runtime or in the runtime on agents. The console can be found at Manage Jenkins > Script Console.

These scripts are build for specific use cases and are probably more useful to me than others.
